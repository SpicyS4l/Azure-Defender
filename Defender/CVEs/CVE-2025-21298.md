### Step 1: Identify Vulnerable Hosts with Recent RTF Email Attachments

```kql
let suspiciousRTF = 
    EmailAttachmentInfo
    | where FileType == "rtf"
    | join EmailEvents on NetworkMessageID
    | where EmailDirection == "Inbound" and LatestDeliveryAction != "Blocked"
    | distinct FileName;
let rtfCreation =
    DeviceFileEvents
    | where ActionType == "FileCreated" and FileName endswith ".rtf"
    | where InitiatingProcessFileName has "outlook"
    | extend FileType = parse_json(AdditionalFields)["FileType"]
    | where FileType == "Rtf"
    | where FileName has_any (suspiciousRTF)
    | distinct DeviceName;
DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities
| where CveId == "CVE-2025-21298"
| where DeviceName has_any (rtfCreation)
| distinct DeviceName
```

### Step 2: Retrieve File Paths of Recently Created RTF Files on Vulnerable Devices

```kql
let hostnames = datatable(DeviceName: string)
    [
        // List of hostnames wrapped in quotes and comma-separated
    ];
let suspiciousRTF = 
    EmailAttachmentInfo
    | where FileType == "rtf"
    | join EmailEvents on NetworkMessageID
    | where EmailDirection == "Inbound" and LatestDeliveryAction != "Blocked"
    | distinct FileName;
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName in (hostnames)
| where ActionType == "FileCreated" and FileName endswith ".rtf"
| where InitiatingProcessFileName has "outlook"
| extend FileType = parse_json(AdditionalFields)["FileType"]
| where FileType == "Rtf"
| where FileName has_any (suspiciousRTF)
| project DeviceName, FileName, FolderPath, Timestamp
```
## Please Note
The `DeviceTvmSoftwareVulnerabilities` table may not always provide comprehensive results. Itâ€™s crucial to perform thorough due diligence to verify that any identified files are not malicious.
